#Text Classification with Naive Bayes (Spam Detection)

This project is an example of text classification for spam detection using the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier. It's designed to classify SMS messages as "ham" or "spam."

#Description

Text classification is a common task in natural language processing and machine learning. In this project, we use the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier to classify SMS messages as either "ham" (non-spam) or "spam." We employ the scikit-learn library for text vectorization and model training.
